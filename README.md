## The plan

Kaparthy has inspired a lot of my thinking as a young developer. With the new educational platform called [Eureka Labs](https://eurekalabs.ai/) and including AI teaching assistants, it gave me some ideas.

I wish I was in the financial situation to really study like I used to on a lot of the more nuanced topics in software or make software that actually benefits the world in some way.
With a newfound delusions of grandeur I couldve sworn were beaten out of me, I decided I would put my pump and dump AI p\*\*n webapps on hold to really try and make something work.
I gave myself a week to get something presentable running and anything longer than that I would just scrap it and go back to my bread and butter.

After looking aroung I came across [Morphic(Github)](https://github.com/miurla/morphic) and [Morphic(Web)](https://www.morphic.sh/) on Vercel Templates. It was a great starting point for the frontend, allowing me to go straight to the backend.

This is where I had some options. For the model, I need something that can quickly recall from a PDF textbook. Fine-tuning for each individual text book is expensive, time consuming, and wouldn't be too helpful in this scenario since I need perfect recall of the page the model retrieved the information.

With retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) I would be able to acheive this, using a less powerful model with this ability will be more beneficial for the students and a selling point for teachers.
